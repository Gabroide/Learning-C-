// A pseudocode for the Word Jumble could be:
// Create an array with different words
// Choose a random word and change letters positions in a random way
// Show the player the word with the letters in a random position
// Ask to the player if he/she can guess the word and offer him/her a hint
// to solve the word.
//
// If the player accepts a hint
//		Show him/her the hint and ask again for the word.
//		Also discount point to the word value as he/she has needed a hint.
//
// If the player fails resolving the word show him/her a failure message
// If the player guess the word
//		Show a congratulation message, the word and his/her score.
